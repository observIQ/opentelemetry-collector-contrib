The transform processor modifies telemetry based on configuration using the [Telemetry Query Language](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/processing.md#telemetry-query-language).
It takes a list of queries which are performed in the order specified in the config.

Queries are composed of the following parts
- Path expressions: Fields within the incoming data can be referenced using expressions composed of the names as defined
in the OTLP protobuf definition. e.g., `status.code`, `attributes["http.method"]`. If the path expression begins with
`resource.` or `instrumentation_library.`, it will reference those values.  For metrics, `name`, `description`, `unit`, `type`, `is_monotonic`, and `aggregation_temporality` are accessed via `metric.`
  - The name `instrumentation_library` within OpenTelemetry is currently under discussion and may be changed in the future.
  - Metric data types are `None`, `Gauge`, `Sum`, `Histogram`, `ExponentialHistogram`, and `Summary`
- Literals: Strings, ints, and floats can be referenced as literal values
- Function invocations: Functions can be invoked with arguments matching the function's expected arguments
- Where clause: Telemetry to modify can be filtered by appending `where a <op> b`, with `a` and `b` being any of the above.

Supported functions:
- `set(target, value)` - `target` is a path expression to a telemetry field to set `value` into. `value` is any value type.
e.g., `set(attributes["http.path"], "/foo")`, `set(name, attributes["http.route"])`. If `value` resolves to `nil`, e.g.
it references an unset map value, there will be no action.

- `keep_keys(target, string...)` - `target` is a path expression to a map type field. The map will be mutated to only contain
the fields specified by the list of strings. e.g., `keep_keys(attributes, "http.method")`, `keep_keys(attributes, "http.method", "http.route")`

- `truncate_all(target, limit)` - `target` is a path expression to a map type field. `limit` is a non-negative integer.  The map will be mutated such that all string values are truncated to the limit. e.g., `truncate_all(attributes, 100)` will truncate all string values in `attributes` such that all string values have less than or equal to 100 characters.  Non-string values are ignored.

- `limit(target, limit)` - `target` is a path expression to a map type field. `limit` is a non-negative integer.  The map will be mutated such that the number of items does not exceed the limit. e.g., `limit(attributes, 100)` will limit `attributes` to no more than 100 items. Which items are dropped is random.

Supported where operations:
- `==` - matches telemetry where the values are equal to each other
- `!=` - matches telemetry where the values are not equal to each other

Example configuration:
```yaml

  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:

exporters:
  nop

processors:
  transform:
    traces:
      queries:
        - set(status.code, 1) where attributes["http.path"] == "/health"
        - keep_keys(resource.attributes, "service.name", "service.namespace", "cloud.region")
        - set(name, attributes["http.route"])
        - limit(attributes, 100)
        - limit(resource.attributes, 100)
        - truncate_all(attributes, 4096)
        - truncate_all(resource.attributes, 4096)
    metrics:
      queries:
        - set(metric.description, "Sum") where metric.type == "Sum"
        - keep_keys(resource.attributes, "host.name")
        - limit(attributes, 100)
        - truncate_all(attributes, 4096)
        - truncate_all(resource.attributes, 4096)
    logs:
      queries:
        - set(severity_text, "FAIL") where body == "request failed"
        - keep_keys(resource.attributes, "service.name", "service.namespace", "cloud.region")
        - set(body, attributes["http.route"])

This processor will perform the operations in order for 


All spans

1) Set status code to OK for all spans with a path `/health`
2) Keep only `service.name`, `service.namespace`, `cloud.region` resource attributes
3) Set `name` to the `http.route` attribute if it is set
4) Limit all span attributes such that each span has no more than 100 attributes.
5) Limit all resource attributes such that each resource no more than 100 attributes.
6) Truncate all span attributes such that no string value has more than 4096 characters.
7) Truncate all resource attributes such that no string value has more than 4096 characters.

All metrics and their data points

1) Set metric description to "Sum" if the metric type is "Sum"
2) Keep only the `host.name` resource attributes
4) Limit all data point attributes such that each data point has no more than 100 attributes.
6) Truncate all data point attributes such that no string value has more than 4096 characters.
7) Truncate all resource attributes such that no string value has more than 4096 characters.

All logs

1) Set severity text to FAIL if the body contains a string text "request failed"
2) Keep only `service.name`, `service.namespace`, `cloud.region` resource attributes
3) Set `body` to the `http.route` attribute if it is set
