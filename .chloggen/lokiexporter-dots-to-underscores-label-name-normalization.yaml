subtext: |
  Loki doesn't support label names containing dots. |
  Users had to convert dot-separated attributes into underscore-separated attributes before promoting them to Loki labels. |
  From now on users can drop relabeling from their configuration. All dots in label names will be replaced with underscores automatically before sending request to Loki.
